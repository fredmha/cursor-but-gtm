# Execution Design

## Purpose

Execution is where strategy becomes shipped work.
It is designed to keep focus while preserving context.

## Core execution views

1. My Issues
- Personal focus lane for individual contributors.

2. Team Pulse
- Shared workload view for managers and operators.

3. Project command views
- Time-bound initiative control with health and update cadence.

4. Channel command views
- Ongoing workstream control with strategic mandates and context feed.

## Execution rules

1. Work belongs to a context
- Tasks are expected to be attached to a channel or project.

2. Status is visible and current
- Progress should be legible at a glance for both individual and team modes.

3. Context follows the task
- Notes, links, and docs should stay near execution work.

## Why this matters

Execution design should reduce two common GTM failures:

- Busy work that is not tied to strategy
- Hidden blockers that surface too late

## Iteration opportunities

1. Prioritization clarity
- Make "most important next actions" more explicit in each view.

2. Blocker handling
- Strengthen escalation paths for stuck work.

3. Cross-team dependencies
- Improve visibility where project and channel work overlap.

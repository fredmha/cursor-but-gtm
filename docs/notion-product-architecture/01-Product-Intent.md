# Product Intent

## Product in one line

GTM OS is a strategy-to-execution workspace for go-to-market teams that want planning, delivery, and context in one operating system.

## Core problem

Most GTM teams split work across separate tools:

- Strategy docs in one place
- Task execution in another
- Timeline planning in another

This creates three failures:

1. Plans are not connected to execution.
2. Teams lose context behind tasks.
3. Weekly rhythm becomes reactive instead of directed.

## Product promise

GTM OS should make every unit of work traceable to strategy, owner, and timeline so teams can move faster with less coordination overhead.

## Primary users

1. GTM leader
- Needs a high-level strategy map and confidence the team is executing the right work.

2. Functional owner (channel or project lead)
- Needs a clear lane, clear priorities, and visibility on progress and blockers.

3. Individual contributor
- Needs a focused personal queue and enough context to execute without hunting for information.

## Desired outcomes

1. Strategic alignment
- Teams can explain why each task exists.

2. Throughput
- More high-value work shipped per week.

3. Clarity
- Less ambiguity on ownership and deadlines.

4. Learning loop
- Teams can review outcomes and adjust quickly.

## Product scope today

The current product already supports:

- Timeline and channel/project planning
- Day-to-day task execution
- A linked document system
- AI-assisted planning and task operations

The next phase is to tighten these into one opinionated operating loop.

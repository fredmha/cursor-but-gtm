# Knowledge System Design

## Purpose

Docs is the context layer of GTM OS.
It should keep strategic reasoning, content assets, and execution references in one place.

## Design intent

The knowledge system supports two creation modes:

1. Structured documents
- For briefs, plans, and reusable templates.

2. Canvas boards
- For visual thinking, mapping, and synthesis.

## Key behaviors

1. Organized repository
- Folders, favorites, recents, and sorting support fast retrieval.

2. Work linkage
- Docs can be linked to tasks, and tasks can be created from docs.

3. Reuse patterns
- Teams can start from templates for common GTM deliverables.

4. Portability
- Content can be exported for distribution and external sharing.

## Product value

1. Fewer context-switches
- Team members do not need separate systems to find rationale.

2. Better decisions
- Strategy context is available where execution decisions happen.

3. Higher reuse
- High-performing templates and frameworks become repeatable assets.

## Iteration opportunities

1. Knowledge quality signals
- Help teams identify stale vs trusted documentation.

2. Faster linking
- Reduce friction when attaching docs to live work.

3. Playbook depth
- Expand template library around full GTM lifecycle stages.

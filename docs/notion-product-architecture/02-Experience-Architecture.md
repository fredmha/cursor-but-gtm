# Experience Architecture

## Product map

The product has five core workspaces that form one operating loop:

1. Roadmap
- Turns strategy into a visible timeline of planned work.

2. Execution
- Runs daily delivery across personal, project, and channel views.

3. Docs
- Stores strategic and tactical context linked to real work.

4. Review
- AI-assisted task operations and progress reflection.

5. Settings
- Defines campaign identity, objective, and team structure.

## Operating loop

1. Define direction
- Team sets campaign name, objective, and time horizon.

2. Shape strategy
- Team maps projects, channels, and timeline markers.

3. Convert to work
- Tasks are created and assigned within clear execution contexts.

4. Execute and adjust
- Team works from focused views and updates status continuously.

5. Capture and reuse context
- Docs and notes stay linked to execution objects.

6. Review and rebalance
- AI and humans review workload, slippage, and next actions.

## Product principle

The product behaves as one system, not a set of disconnected modules:

- Strategy should always resolve into executable work.
- Execution should always retain business context.
- Review should always feed back into planning.

## Why this architecture matters

This model is designed to reduce the strategic drift that appears when planning and execution happen in different systems.

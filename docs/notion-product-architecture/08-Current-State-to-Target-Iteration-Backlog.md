# Current State To Target Iteration Backlog

## Snapshot summary

Current product shape is strong across roadmap, execution, docs, and AI support.
The next phase is to make the full loop tighter, safer, and more opinionated.

## Priority themes

1. End-to-end operating loop quality
- Goal: planning, execution, and review should feel like one continuous flow.

2. AI trust and control
- Goal: clear approval boundaries and predictable AI actions.

3. Focus and prioritization clarity
- Goal: users should always know what matters now.

4. Knowledge-to-execution velocity
- Goal: reduce friction from document insight to task action.

## Candidate iteration bets

1. Standardize AI action approvals
- Outcome: higher trust and fewer accidental changes.

2. Add explicit weekly review product surface
- Outcome: stronger cadence for progress reflection and replanning.

3. Strengthen dependency and risk visibility in roadmap/execution
- Outcome: earlier detection of delivery risk.

4. Improve top-priority signal in execution views
- Outcome: less task overload, better daily focus.

5. Expand strategy and content playbook templates
- Outcome: faster onboarding and more repeatable GTM quality.

## Proposed sequencing

1. AI control and safety
2. Weekly operating rhythm
3. Prioritization and dependency clarity
4. Template and playbook expansion

## Open product questions

1. What level of AI autonomy is acceptable by default?
2. Should weekly review be mandatory in the operating loop?
3. Is the product primarily manager-led, IC-led, or balanced?
4. Which success metric matters most in the next 60 days: throughput, predictability, or strategic alignment?

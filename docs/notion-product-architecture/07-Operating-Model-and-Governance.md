# Operating Model And Governance

## Purpose

This model defines how teams should use GTM OS as a weekly operating system, not just a tracker.

## Structural model

1. Campaign
- The active operating cycle with one objective and time boundary.

2. Projects
- Finite initiatives with explicit ownership and health.

3. Channels
- Ongoing execution lanes for always-on distribution work.

4. Tasks
- Atomic units of execution tied to either a project or a channel.

## Team model

1. Shared workspace
- Multiple team members can contribute to planning and execution context.

2. Role clarity
- Leads drive direction, owners run lanes, contributors execute scoped work.

3. Review rhythm
- The system should support daily focus and weekly adjustment.

## Governance principles

1. No orphan work
- Every task should be attached to strategic context.

2. Context with execution
- Links, notes, and docs are part of task quality, not optional extras.

3. Living plan
- Roadmap is continuously updated from execution reality.

4. Lightweight control
- Process exists to increase clarity and speed, not bureaucracy.

## Product goal for governance

Make strong operating behavior the default so good planning discipline does not depend on heroic project management effort.

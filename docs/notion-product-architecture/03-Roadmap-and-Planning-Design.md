# Roadmap And Planning Design

## Purpose

Roadmap is the strategic control plane.
It helps teams answer:

- What are we trying to achieve this cycle?
- Which initiatives are finite projects vs ongoing channels?
- What is sequenced now, later, or not yet scheduled?

## Design intent

The roadmap combines two planning levels:

1. Strategy Horizon
- Time-bound initiatives and their major execution windows.

2. Channel lanes
- Ongoing distribution workstreams where execution tasks live.

## Key planning behaviors

1. Weekly timeline markers
- Teams can mark launches, themes, and important moments.

2. Scheduled and unscheduled work
- Teams can keep backlog ideas visible without forcing false dates.

3. Direct transition to execution
- Planned items convert into actionable work instead of staying as static plan artifacts.

## User value

1. Leaders
- See whether plan shape matches strategic goals.

2. Managers
- Detect overload and sequencing risk early.

3. ICs
- Understand why upcoming work is prioritized.

## Iteration opportunities

1. Planning quality
- Add clearer guidance for tradeoffs between channels and projects.

2. Confidence signals
- Improve visibility of plan risk before deadlines slip.

3. Scenario planning
- Support quick what-if alternatives for major priority changes.
